# Bubble repository

This is a public repository for organising our frontend work on Bubble.   
-> Don't look for code here, there is none 

## Policy

Please, keep in mind this is public. Everyone one in the world can see this, which implies
- to speak english only
- to be polite
- to take time to describe every issue you write down, so that newcomer could understand what it is about 

## Security

Again, this is public so never 
- write anything
- share a loom
- include a screeshot
that contains a key, a token, an environment variable... that could be a serious security threat !

## Recruit
We are hiring, feel free to drop an email here : `join.tech @usealto.com`


Enjoy,
